# my python for finance journey

this repository contains the projects and scripts i'm building as i follow my 9-month learning plan to break into finance.

## week 1: python & sql basics
* **`interest_calculator.py`**: a simple script that calculates simple interest based on user input for principal, rate, and time.

## week 1.1: intro to data analysis
* **`week1-1_analyzer.py`**: a script that uses the pandas library to read student grades from a `grades.csv` file and calculates basic statistics.

## week 1.2: grouping & aggregation
* **`week1-2_sector_analyzer.py`**: reads a sample of bist company data and uses pandas `groupby()` to calculate the average market cap for each sector.
